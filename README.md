# kurma

Appearing in the forms of a swan [Hamsa], a tortoise [Kurma], a fish [Matsya],
O foremost of regenerate ones, I shall then display myself as a boar [Varaha],
then as a Man-lion (Nrisingha), then as a dwarf [Vamana], then as Rama of
Bhrigu's race, then as Rama, the son of Dasaratha, then as Krishna the scion of
the Sattwata race, and lastly as Kalki.

— Book 12, Santi Parva, Chapter CCCXL (340), translated by Kisari Mohan
Ganguli, 1883-1896[32]
